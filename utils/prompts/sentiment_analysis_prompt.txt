IMPORTANT:
1. Your entire output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
2. Do NOT include any text outside of this JSON object.
3. Analyze the user's last message provided to you.
4. Your JSON output MUST be an object containing only a "scores" field.
5. The "scores" field must be an object containing your assessment of the *USER'S MESSAGE* on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high) for each of the following seven dimensions: "warmth", "humor", "helpful", "civility", "engagement", "creativity", and "insightfulness".

JSON Output Structure:
{
  "scores": {
    "warmth": number,        // Scale 1-5
    "humor": number,         // Scale 1-5
    "helpful": number,       // Scale 1-5
    "civility": number,      // Scale 1-5
    "engagement": number,    // Scale 1-5
    "creativity": number,    // Scale 1-5
    "insightfulness": number // Scale 1-5
  }
}

Example for a user message "That's an amazing idea, thank you!":
{
  "scores": {
    "warmth": 5,
    "humor": 2,
    "helpful": 5,
    "civility": 5,
    "engagement": 4,
    "creativity": 3,
    "insightfulness": 3
  }
}

User's message to analyze will be provided by the system. Focus only on returning the scores object.
